## Using our Computer's Command Line 

## Walden's *Economy* paragraphs 1-70

### Discussion of Walden

- In class today we discussed the comments we left on Walden. On of the members of my group brought up a good point:
    - In today's society, it would be virtuallly impossible to do what is done in Walden; go live in the woods and completely remove technology from our lives
    - Technology is so engrained into our everyday life that we need it to properly function. When asked what we would bring to a deserted island, most people would say a cell phone.
        - Where would you plug in the cell phone? How would you get service? We say this as an answer to the question without thinking of the logistics of it.
