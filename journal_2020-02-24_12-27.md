## Things I learned today

### tips-n-tricks in the command line

- Tips-n-tricks channel on slack
    - information that provides shortcuts on how to get to a certain file or directory in the command line
    - dragging and dropping files into the command line from your GUI using 'cd'
- Spaces in the command line
    - the command line doesn't like the space because it registers as a change in command
    - using a backslash is called an escape - this will tell the command line to ignore the space
    - You can also put quotation marks around the file path to tell the command line to ignore the space.

 - In Github
    - There is a file with commands and descriptions of the commands and what they do for use in the command line

### Close-reading v. Hyper Reading

- Hyper reading is basically skimming
    - reading a text quickly and attempting to pick out the important facts that the author makes
- Close-reading
    - reading the text word for word and absorbing what the author intends and their arguments
