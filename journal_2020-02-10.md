## GUI, GIT, Navagating Your Computer

### Today's Class:

- GUI
    - Graphical User Interface
    - Throughout the semester, we will be working on getting out of this interface.
    - Everything in your computer is structured like a heiracrhy, with your hard drive situated at the top.

- Files and Folders
    - Directories
    - In the terminal, you will not see any pictures of folders like you see in the GUI.

- File Paths
    - Every file in your computer has its own address that you can use to locate it.
    - In a *browser*:
        - **file:///Users/yourusername/path/**

- GIT
    - If you open a terminal, type in the following:
        -  $ git --version 
            - This informed me that my computer is running version 2.21.1 (Apple Git 122.3)

## Different Style of Writing Text
- In the Markdown file, you will see a different series of infomration that will allow you to create headings, paragraphs, insert pictures and links in a certian way, but when you save the file as .md, it will show up as plain text like it shows below.  

<p>paragraph</p>
<img src="path/to/file.jpg"/>
<h1>heading 1</h1>
<h2>heading 2</h2>
