## Types of Reading Review

Over the course of this semester, we have discussed a few different kinds of reading. Below is a review of the typpes we have covered so far.

- Close Reading
    - refers to a kind of reading that identifies meaningful patterns in a text
    - Generates interpretations
- Hyperreading
    - type of reading motivated less by the search of contextual reading and more by the need to quickly find important information within your source
- Machine Reading
    - relies on the power of compution
    - Finding meaningful patters accros a corpus that may contain thousands of texts
    - Think distant reading

Today, we will discuss a new type of reading

### Metareading

- Metareading is a type of reading that we do when one is looking for something to say *about* the text
    - like if its a novel or a poem
- Examples of Metareading
    - trying to discover who authored a poem that was published anonymously 
    - trying to determine which version of the text best represents an authors intentions
    - trying to determine the best way to present a text to readers
- Metareading involves making declarative claims about a text as a text
    - These claims are rarely ever claims of fact
        - they involve interpretive judgments

### Fluid Text

- The implication that all literary text is inherently fluid
    - Literature is not an idea that is fully formed in the authors mind, but rather the prodcut of multiple revisions - thus fluid
- Instead of thinking of a text as a fixed or stable object, think of it as an ongoing project
    - "A work" as the final product as well as the work that went into making it
- Fluid text emphasizes that a reader thinks less about the final product and more about the work that went into the final product

### Walden as a Fluid Text

- A text's fluidity is most evident when there is a manuscript, like we have with *Walden*
- *Walden* underwent severaly revisions between 1845, when Henry Davide Thoreau began his piece, and April of 1854, when it was published
    - Think: How should Thoreau's revisions to *Walden* affect out understanding of the book?

### Creating a fluid text edition of *Walden*

- To create a fluid-text edition, we will use many different new programs - XML/TEI and the Versioning Machine. These will work together to track the changes over the different revisions of *Walden*
