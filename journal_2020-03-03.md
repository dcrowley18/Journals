## One-on-One meeting with Dr. Schacht: Undoing or reseting things through the terminal on github

- Today, i met with Dr. Schacht to discuss a problem i was having pushing my journal files to github
    - Originally, when i would try to push a journal file, i would get an error that said i didnt have local access to upload the file.
    - After some trouble shooting, we found that my github repsoitory and my folder were not in sync, due to edits i made in github but not on my computer.
    - In order to remedy the issue, we needed to remove the file and re-upload it so we could get my terminal and github on the same page.

### Commands for undoing things in github

- Dr. Schacht provided a cheat sheet of github commands, as well as a website with tutorials on the topic, linked below.
