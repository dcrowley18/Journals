## XML/TEI and Literay Study in the Digital Age

### Understanding TEI Markup

- Below is what a basic TEI file looks like:
    `<!-- SOME TEXT OR OTHER HERE. -->`
    - these bits of texts are comments. They serve no fuction in the file but help to explain what different parts of the document are.
    - comments help to document what you are attempting to accomplish in a markup.
- Main components of a TEI file:
    - XMl declaration and other infromation about the encoding
    - Root element of TEI
        - this is enclosed between `<TEI>` and `</TEI>`
    - TEI Header
        - enclosed between `<teiHeader>` and `</teiHeader>`
        - Information about the encoding project and the document being encoded goes here.
    - TEI Text 
        - enclosed between `<text>` and `</text>`
        - What does into a TEI text is dependant on the textual conten to be encoded and the decisions made by the encoding team.
- TEI element meanings
    - `<app>` = an element that introduces a place of variance from the base text.
    - `<lem>` = an element that contains the text as it appears in the base version.
    - `<rdg>` = an element that indicates how the text reads in one or more of the witnesses.
        - in this tag, you'll find the attribute `wit`, whose value `wit = something` will be an identifier for one or more of the versions.
    - `<del>` = used to indicate deleted text.
    - `<add>` = used to indicate added text.
        - insertions can take place inside deletions. See example below:
        `<del><add>book</add></del>`
- **Remember**: this markup wont tell a browser how to displat these changes on a web page. XML is a metalanguage used for making declarations about a text as a text, not a formatting language. 
    - If you want to display the changes in a browser, you need to first transform XML into HTML.
