## First Day of Online Classes

Today began the Soft Roll Out of SUNY Geneseo Online Classes. Below are my thoughts so far on the change to remote learning due to the COIVD19 pandemic:

- First, all of my professors are doing different things, as to be expected. Some professors are choosing to do syncronized learning, while others are doing asyncronized.
    - Syncronized - meeting at the same time as our regularly scheduled class time over an online video chat format
    - Asyncronized - Self-paced learning in which the students have the opportunity to meet with their professor but can watch lectures and complete work at their own pace.
        - I prefer the Asyncronized approach; it is easier for me to work out a schedule using this method while at home then with a sycnronized format.
- Second, I really hate Blackboard Collaborate.
    - Two of my professors have elected to use this videochat option available through canvas to conduct class.
    - My issue with it:
        - BlackBoard collaborate lags very badly. One of my professors likes to type things into the screen while shes teaching, as if it is a projector, but often time thes text lags and does not show up for a long time. This is a problem because by the time the text has appeared, the professor has moved onto the nect topic.
- Finally, it seems to me like there is a lot of uncertainly regarding the move to remote learning.
    - To me, based on the information I have recieved from my professors, it seems like no one really knows what is going on. The professors are just as confused as the students are with this change.
        - Personally, I have had one or two professors provide an updated syllabus, which has been a great help to build my schedule around. I would like to see my other three professors do the same.
