## Things I Learned Today

### Markdown

Wow! This is my *very first* markdown file!

I'm impressed with myself for **these reasons**:

- I have never done coding before so this is new for me
- I was able to become more familiar with Visual Studio
- I was able to get hands on experience with using the Markdown formatting method
- I'm on my way to becoming a [digital humanist] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities)

## Thoughts on Today's Class Discussions

### *The Information* Chapter 2

Today, we broke into small groups and discussed what we each found interesting while reading the second chapter of *The Information*

I particularly found the following points to be **the most** interesting:

- The alphabet was only invented once, but almost every culture on the planet changed it to work for them. They made the technology fit the needs of their society.

## HTML and Wordpress

### What I learned Today:

In class today we learned: 

- how to *create* our blog posts in Wordpress, *save* them as a draft, and *post* them onto our groups page.
- How to use the HTML formatting method.
    
    - including how to view a page source on a webpage, which allows us to see the HTML formatting that is on that page.
- How to create a **index.htlm** file in our projects folder for this course.
- The commands to input into markdown and Visusal Studio Code to create a HTML file and open it in a web browser

Throughout this course, I have found it increasingly interesting the information that is acuatlly available to us on the internet. One can view the markup language, the HTML formatting, and other sources of imformation that makes a webpage, a webpage.
