## Reflection on this Semester

This semester was a rollarcoster ride and an interesting one to say the least. I certainly never expected to be in an era of remote learning and to be in an era of social distancing. This semester brought a series of new challenges, new ideas, and new goals.

For starters, learning how to learn at home and on the computer was one of the biggest challeneges of this semester. However, the transition was easier than I origainally anticipated because of the excellent relationship I have with my computer, on that has been being built and growing throughout this semester. I feel that I have learned how to do a lot of different things on my computer and have been able to learn how it works best for me and an easy and stress free way, which has made this process very easy to transition into.

Being stuck at home is a challenge, but finding things to do has been fun. I feel I have gotten more in touch with my creative side when trying to find activities to keep busy at home while also emphasizing social distancing exercise activites, such as doing yoga in my room or starting to ride bikes outside when it isn't snowing in May. 

All-in-all, the biggest upset of this semester is not being able to be on campus with my friends to end their senior year and to continue in person instruction. I miss being with people and I hate that trips to visit friends that I haven't seen in a while have been canceled. But, I do know that when this is all over I'll be able to see them again. It just kinda suck that I have to wait.

My fingers are crossed that I will see everyone on campus in the fall. Good luck and stay safe!
