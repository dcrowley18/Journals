## Machines that Read

### Benefits of your computer being able to understand a text
- Machine-readable description enables a computer program to display the marked-up text in multiple ways.
- A computer can look through a marked-up text for certain tags for analysis.

### TEI for Data Analysis
- `<seg>` tag indicates the version history of a specific paragraph.
    - In the *Walden* manuscript, we can see that the first paragraph was originally written in version A, then rewritten in both version B and version D. 
    - When this information is encoded in TEI, a computer can pull the information for anaylsis.
