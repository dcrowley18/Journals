# Timeline JS

## Creating a larger Timeline

For the final project, our group was tasked with creating a larger timeline to document the revisions that were given to *Walden* throughout the various versions of the text. Below are a few things I learned during this process:
- Having sloppy handwriting is the worst
    - I finally understand why professors and teachers always want handwriting to be neat, trying to read sloppy handwriting, like the kind that Thoreau has, is a pain in the neck.
    - the sloppy handwriting made finding and locating the manuscript pages much harder than expected, but once I got into a groove with them, it became much easier.
- Find the manuscript pages as you go
    - I found it easier to find the manuscript pages as I created the timeline. This made it easier for me to not lose track of what page I was on and how it correlated to the pages in the Walden Manuscript Spreadsheet.
    - It also made it easier for me to take breaks in between my work and not lose track of where I was and what I was writing about.
- Thoreau's revisions tell you a lot about the text
    - going through the revisions, even for just the small section my group chose to use, was fun and says a lot about Thoreau as a writer and Thoreau as a person in the woods.
        - I founds the penciled in text particularly interesting because, as Dr. Schacht pointed out to me, they almost seem to be after throughts by Thoreau. When you actually read them, it seemed to me that Thoreau had an after thought that said "This sounds kinda crazy, I should justify what I meant," - which I think is very telling about Thoreau's mental health and the impact being alone in the woods had on it, especially in later chapters/
- Timelines are pretty fun to make
    - After putting everything into the spreadsheet, I feel really good about the final product. I think it came out really well and it flows in a good way. I'm happy that its finished and am looking forward ot moving on to the next part of the Final project.
