## Python

### Today, we began to learn the basics of python

- python is a coding language that, while it takes some time to learn, is easy to understand.
- To learn python, we are using anaconda, a downloadable resource that allows the user to take notes on the code they are writing withing the program.
    - It also allows you to mix coding languages -  you can write markdown and python in one notebook file.
    - Below a link to an anaconda quick starter guide and cheet sheet

- Python is input controlled. For instance, if you type in 5 + 2 in an input, the langauge will create the output of 7.
    - We have down very little with Python as of right now, but below is a quick starter guide and cheet sheet. Ideally, by looking this over one would become more familiar with the program language.
