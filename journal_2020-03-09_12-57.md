## International Women's Day

Today in class, we took some time to discuss various woman figures who have made significant advancements in computing and design

- *Hidden Figures*
    - This is a film that tells the story of three women who worked for NASA. Nicknamed "The Computers," they were charged with completing specific equations by hand which would be used to send an astronaut into orbit. 
    -  The film was released in 2017 and is based of a book of the same name.

While I was unable to get down all of the women we discusses, I appreciated being able to be in an environment that was able to have that discussion. I think that ebing able to learn more about women how have contributed to computers and science was enjoyable and allowed me to learn more about the contributions women have made throughout history that are often times overlooked or ignored.

## More work with Python

- 1 + 4
    - this input in python creates an output of the mathmatical equation
- print("Hello World")
    - this input makes an output of what is in the quotation marks
- type(["cake", "ice cream", "candy"])
    - this type of input creates a list output
- foods = ("cake", ice cream", "candy")
    - this input creates a name for out list
- for food in foods:
    - print ("I" + "like" + "food")
        - this input puts the "i like" in front of the food in your created list

## Using Python skills in Text
- using the following repositiory in github
    - [introduction to text analysis](https://github.com/WhatTheDickens/text-analysis/blob/master/sections/overview.md)
- import nltk
    - this is a downloader, this will allow you to download certain files into your notebooks
- import matplotlib
    - this command enables you to see graphs of some of the information you are working on

**if you close out of your notebook in anaconda, you will need to rerun the above listed imports**

- nltk.download()
    - this command opens up the nltk downloader
- from nltk.book import *
    - this imports the files you just downloaded from nltk

- python can also be used to search for words
    - typing text1.concordance("whale") found all the times "whale" was in the downloaded text
- you can also find words that are similar to a word
    - typing text1.similar("love") finds all the words that are similar to the word "love"
- text1 or text2?
    - we have two downloaded texts in python right now. Using text1 indicates that we are looking at Moby Dick
    - text2 indicates that we are using Jane Austin.
    - there are more texts - using a different text number will change the text you are looking at or applying your input command to
