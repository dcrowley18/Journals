## Text Encoding

### What you need to know:

- TEI = Text Encoding Initiative
    - used for the collaborative scholarly effort the gives rise to metalanguage and the metalanguage itself.
    - [link to TEI Consortium](https://tei-c.org/)
        - This consortium collectively developes and maintains a standard representation of texts in a digital form. 
    - TEI is an example of XML
        - XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
- TEI is extremely similar to the HTML coding language
    - TEI, XML, HTML - all of these are metalanguages
- While HTML is concerned with formatting a document in a web browser, *TEI has no concern with formatting*. 
    - **TEI's main purpose is to make statements about a text**

### What certain codes stand for:
- `<lg>` = element
    - `<lg type=>` = attribute which can be filled with any number of values
    - ex. `<lg type= "stanza">`
    - the `<lg>` element include `"free"` for grounds of unrhymed lines and `"quatrain"` for groups of four lines.
- `<l>` `</l>` = Surrounds a line

### More about the TEI language
- TEI markup tells you more about the aspects and the sturcture of a piece.
- TEI translates familiar language of visual displat into a language of symbols.

### Why use TEI?
- Computers arent good with undestanding works flecibly, adjusting the term to be understood within the given circumstances.
    - By using TEI, you can describe what is happening in the text to your computer. This allows youre computer to undertsand it thorugh the percise metalanguage and consistency that TEI provides.
